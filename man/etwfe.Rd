  tvar = NULL,
  gvar = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  ivar = NULL,
  xvar = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{fml}{A formula with the outcome (lhs) and any time-constant controls 
variables (rhs), e.g. `y ~ x1 + x2`. Please note that time-varying controls
are not supported. Similarly, if no additional controls are required, the 
rhs must take the value of 0 or 1, e.g. `y ~ 0`.}

\item{tvar}{Time variable. Can be a string (e.g., "year") or an expression
(e.g., year).}

\item{gvar}{Group variable. Can be either a string (e.g., "first_treated") 
or an expression (e.g., first_treated). In a staggered treatment setting, 
the group variable typically denotes treatment cohort.}

\item{data}{The data frame that you want to run ETWFE on.}

\item{ivar}{Optional index variable. Can be a string (e.g., "country") or an 
expression (e.g., country). Leaving as NULL (the default) will result in
group-level fixed effects being used, which is more efficient and necessary 
for nonlinear models (see `family` argument below). However, you may still
want to cluster your standard errors by your index variable through the
`vcov` argument. See examples below.}

\item{xvar}{Optional interacted categorical covariate for estimating
heterogeneous treatment effects. In other words, allows recovery of the
(marginal) treatment effect for distinct values of `xvar`. Works with binary
categorical variables (e.g. "adult" or "child"), as well as multiple values.}

\item{tref}{Optional reference value for `tvar`. Defaults to its minimum 
value (i.e., the first time period observed in the dataset).}

\item{gref}{Optional reference value for `gvar`. You shouldn't need to 
provide this if your `gvar` variable is well specified. But providing an 
explicit reference value can be useful/necessary if the desired control 
group takes an unusual value.}

\item{cgroup}{What control group do you wish to use for 
estimating treatment effects. Either "notyet" treated (the default) or
"never" treated.}

\item{fe}{What level of fixed effects should be used? Defaults to "vs" 
(varying slopes), which is the most efficient in terms of estimation and 
terseness of the return model object. The other two options, "feo" (fixed 
effects only) and "none" (no fixed effects whatsoever), trade off efficiency
for additional information on other (nuisance) model parameters. Note that
the primary treatment parameters of interest should remain unchanged 
regardless of choice.}

\item{family}{Which [`family`] to use for the estimation. Defaults to NULL, in 
which case [`fixest::feols`] is used. Otherwise passed to [`fixest::feglm`], so
that valid entries include "logit", "poisson", and "negbin". Note that if a
non-NULL family entry is detected, `ivar` will automatically be set to NULL.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to [`fixest::feols`] (or 
[`fixest::feglm`]). The most common example would be a `vcov` argument.}
}
\value{
A fixest object with fully saturated interaction effects.

\examples{
# We’ll use the mpdta dataset from the did package (which you’ll need to 
# install separately).

# install.packages("did")
data("mpdta", package = "did")

# Run the estimation
mod = etwfe(
    fml  = lemp ~ lpop, # outcome ~ controls
    tvar = year,        # time variable
    gvar = first.treat, # group variable
    data = mpdta,       # dataset
    vcov = ~countyreal  # vcov adjustment (here: clustered by county)
    )
mod

# We can recover a variety of treatment effects of interest with the 
# complementary emfx() function. For example:
emfx(mod, type = "event")
