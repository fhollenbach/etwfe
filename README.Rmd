# Extended Two-way Fixed Effects (ETWFE)

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/etwfe/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/etwfe/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **etwfe** is to estimate extended two-way fixed effects _a la_
Wooldridge ([2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3906345),
[2022](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4183726)).  Briefly,
Wooldridge proposes a set of saturated interaction effects to overcome the
potential bias problems of vanilla TWFE in difference-in-differences designs.
The Wooldridge solution is intuitive and elegant, but rather tedious and error
prone to code up manually. The **etwfe** package aims to simplify the process by
providing convenience functions that do the work for you. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of **etwfe** from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("grantmcdermott/etwfe")
```

## Quickstart example

A detailed walkthrough of the package is provided in the introductory vignette.
See `vignette("etwfe")`. Here's a quickstart example to demonstrate the basic
syntax.

```{r mpdta}
library(etwfe)

# install.packages("did")
data("mpdta", package = "did")
head(mpdta)

# Estimate the model
mod =
  etwfe(
    fml  = lemp ~ lpop, # outcome ~ controls
    tvar = year,        # time variable
    gvar = first.treat, # group variable
    data = mpdta,       # dataset
    vcov = ~countyreal  # vcov adjustment (here: clustered)
    )
mod

# Event-study treatment effects
emfx(mod, type = "event") |>
  summary()
```
