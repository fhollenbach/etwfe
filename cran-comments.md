## Overview

This `etwfe` 0.3.0 update fixes the CRAN errors in version 0.2.0, which were due 
to some breaking changes in an upstream dependency. In addition, I have added
some new features for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and improved
performance with large models. A full changelog is provided in the NEWS file.

Many thanks for reviewing.
