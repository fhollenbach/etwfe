# etwfe 0.2.9003 (development version)

## Enhancements

- Support for heterogeneous treatment effects via the new `xvar` interacted
covariate argument (#16, thanks @frederickluser).
- `emfx` accepts a new `collapse` argument that can substantially reduce 
estimation times for large datasets (#19. thanks @frederickluser). This
performance boost does trade off against a loss in estimate accuracy. But
testing suggests that the difference is relatively minor for typical use cases
(i.e., results equivalent up to the 1st or 2nd decimal place; see #18 for some 
examples). Please let us know if you find edge cases where this is not true.

## Bug fixes

- Internal code and tests have been updated to match some breaking changes in
**marginaleffects** 0.9.0 (#20, thanks @vincentarelbundock).

# etwfe 0.2.0

## Bug fixes and breaking changes

- The `.Dtreat` indicator variable created during the `etwfe` call is now
logical instead of integer (#14). This fix yields slightly different effect
sizes for `emfx` output when applied to non-linear model families (e.g.,
`etwfe(..., family = "poisson")`. The reason is that we are now implicitly
calling `marginaleffects::comparisons` under the hood rather than
`marginaleffects::marginaleffects`. Note that the main `etwfe` coefficients (for
any family) are unaffected, and the same is also true for `emfx` when applied to
a linear model (i.e., the default).

- The (optional) `ivar` argument of `etwfe()` has been moved down the argument 
order list from second position to fifth (i.e., after the `data` argument). This
means that the four required arguments of function now occupy the top positions,
which could enable shorter, unnamed notation like
`etwfe(y ~ x, year, cohort, dat)`.

## Enhancements

- `emfx` now allows (time-invariant) interacted control variables on the fml RHS.

- `emfx` now has a `post_only` logical argument, which may be useful for plotting
aesthetics (but not inference). See the example in the introductory vignette.
- Various improvements to the documentation (restructuring, fixed typos, etc.)
