# Extended two-way fixed effects (ETWFE)

<!-- badges: start -->

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/etwfe/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/etwfe/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

The goal of **etwfe** is to estimate extended (Mundlak) two-way fixed
effects *a la* [Wooldridge
(2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3906345).
Briefly, Wooldridge proposes a set of saturated interaction effects to
overcome the potential bias problems of vanilla TWFE in
difference-in-differences designs. The Wooldridge solution is intuitive
and elegant, but rather tedious and error prone to code up manually.
This package aims to simplify the process by providing convenience
functions that do the work for you. **etwfe** thus provides an R
equivalent of the
[`JWDID`](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459114.html) Stata
module and, indeed, shares some of the core design elements (albeit with
some internal differences).

While I’ve tested **ewtfe** against common use cases, please note that
the package is still under early development and should be considered
experimental. I plan (hope) to add some more features and the
documentation could also be improved. You can help by identifying any
bugs and filing issues.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **etwfe** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("grantmcdermott/etwfe")
```

*Note:* **etwfe** relies on the current development versions of
**fixest** and **marginaleffects**. Your system will need to compile
**fixest**’s C++ source code for installation to work. (Windows users:
install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools). Mac
users: install [Xcode](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/). Linux users:
you should be good to go.) Once these dependencies get submitted to
CRAN, I’ll submit this package to CRAN too so that binaries are
available for easy install.

## Examples

To demonstrate the core functionality of **etwfe**, we’ll use the
`mpdta` dataset from the **did** package. (You’ll need to install the
latter separately.)

``` r
# install.packages("did")
data("mpdta", package = "did")
head(mpdta)
#>     year countyreal     lpop     lemp first.treat treat
#> 866 2003       8001 5.896761 8.461469        2007     1
#> 841 2004       8001 5.896761 8.336870        2007     1
#> 842 2005       8001 5.896761 8.340217        2007     1
#> 819 2006       8001 5.896761 8.378161        2007     1
#> 827 2007       8001 5.896761 8.487352        2007     1
#> 937 2003       8019 2.232377 4.997212        2007     1
```

Now let’s see a simple example.[^1]

``` r
library(etwfe)

mod = 
  etwfe(
    fml  = lemp ~ lpop,           # outcome ~ controls
    tvar = year,                  # time variable
    gvar = first.treat, gref = 0, # group variable (with bespoke ref. level)
    data = mpdta,                 # dataset
    vcov = ~countyreal            # vcov adjustment (here: clustered)
    )

```

As you can see, the key `etwfe()` function is effectively a wrapper
around `fixest::feols()`. (Although, nonlinear models are also supported
via the `family` argument.) The resulting object is thus fully
compatible with other **fixest** methods and functions like `etable()`.

``` r
fixest::etable(mod, signif.code = NA)

While everyone likes a nice regression table, the raw coefficients from
an `etwfe()` estimation are not necessarily meaningful in of themselves.
Instead, we probably want to aggregate them along some dimension of
interest (e.g., an event study). A natural way to perform these
aggregations is by calculating marginal effects. The **etwfe** package
provides another convenience function for doing this, `emfx()`, which is
itself a thin(ish) wrapper around `marginaleffects::marginaleffects()`.

``` r
# Other type options incl. "simple" (default), "calendar", and "group"
emfx(mod, type = "event")
#>      Term    Contrast event   Effect Std. Error z value   Pr(>|z|)    2.5 %   97.5 %

[^1]: Note that the `gref` argument will be unnecessary in most cases.
    But we invoke it here explicitly, since the “never-treated” group in
    the `mpdta` dataset takes on an unusual value (here: 0). See the
    `?etwfe` helpfile for information about other function arguments
    that can be used to further customize the underlying estimation.
